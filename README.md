# Ventaker v1.0.2
A Vencord plugin to allow for walltaker backgrounds to be set on Vencord (supports video and sound)
Also check out the absolutely great plugin for better discord: https://github.com/Lycraon/Lycraons-Walltaker-BBD-plugin
A lot of the work in this one was made using it as a reference! Go show it some love!

## Usage
Once the plugin is enabled, open its settings box located on the plugin square itself. Inside you will find many color tweaks (only for when not using a theme, also may or may not work. I'm busy so I'm getting it out the door now, instead of checking it :3) and two values you **MUST** change, which are the interval for checking for new backgrounds, and the link.
## Other Info
**This is intended to be used with the https://github.com/Eldrazi7604/Walltaker-Vision theme for Vencord. This theme is transparent and allows for editing by changing the values found within the "Walltaker-Vision.theme.css" file**
